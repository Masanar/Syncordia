# Pending or Important task

Check list to track the progress and current working on

## Woking on

Cuando hay varios edits en el mismos commit hay el supervisor debe acumular las lineas
nuevas (deletes tambien?) que se han insertado para que se los pase al siguiente

## Pending

    - [x] Send the confirmation message to the sender when inserte a new incoming
    message.
    - [ ] TODO: When calculating the distance between the clocks, need the case when the
    value is less than or equal to 0, this is probably due to an interiving solved case. 
    - [ ] TODO: When adding a new line to the document change update the commit_at list?
    in the receving peer?

    - [ ] TODO: revie the distance, it is possible to be distance 0, we are comparing the 
    receving projection howcome that we have a message from the recing peer that has 0 
    as a distance that means that we have all the information from that peer.

## Ideas

    - Using the sucsefully inserted message we can update receiving peer clock??
